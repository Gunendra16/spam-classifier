## Introduction

CommuniFilter is a machine learning project designed to filter out spam messages from SMS and email communications. By leveraging advanced text classification algorithms, CommuniFilter aims to improve the security and efficiency of communication systems.

## Features

- High precision and accuracy in spam detection.
- Trained on a diverse set of labeled SMS and email data.
- Supports various machine learning models and techniques.
- Easy to integrate into existing communication platforms.

## Installation

To install and run CommuniFilter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gunendra16/CommuniFilter.git
   cd CommuniFilter
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format (see the [Dataset](#dataset) section for more details).
2. Train the model using your dataset:
   ```sh
   python train.py --data_path <path_to_your_dataset>
   ```

3. Use the trained model to classify messages:
   ```sh
   python classify.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --message <message_to_classify>
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of labeled SMS and email data. Each entry should be categorized as either spam or non-spam. Ensure the dataset is clean and preprocessed before training.

## Model

CommuniFilter supports various machine learning models. By default, it uses a Random Forest classifier, but it can be easily configured to use other models like SVM, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of CommuniFilter using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Example:
```sh
python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --test_data_path <path_to_test_data>
```
